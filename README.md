----------------------------
Challenge of making 30 mini-projects using HTML and CSS during 30 days!
Idealized by  https://github.com/MilenaCarecho/30diasDeCSS.

## What I want to accomplish with this:
:cherry_blossom: Try new things everyday;

:cherry_blossom: Learn more about CSS;

:cherry_blossom: Create new skills;

## Rules - Restarted (17/9/2020)
:cherry_blossom: One project everyday;

:cherry_blossom: Otherwise, 3 projects in the next day;

:cherry_blossom: Time limit: 23:59pm;

:cherry_blossom: Post the result in LinkedIn and/or other social media;

## Days
**Day 1 - Social media icon in layers**

Because of this project:

:cherry_blossom: Used ```transform:translate();``` for the first time!

:cherry_blossom: Used ```transform: rotate() skew();``` for the first time!

:cherry_blossom: Used ```box-shadow:``` for the first time!

:cherry_blossom: Used ```transition:``` for the first time!

:cherry_blossom: Discovered what ```height:100mv;``` means!

Extra challenge:
Change the color text for black when hover + altered transition time.

**Day 2 - Animated Loader**

Because of this project:

:cherry_blossom: Used ```background: linear-gradient``` for the first time!

:cherry_blossom: Used ```@keyframes``` and ```animation:``` for the first time!


Extra challenge:
Use two curves, different directions, the first one faster than the second one and the second one inside the first one.


**Day 3 - Text changes its color when in another div**

Because of this project:

:cherry_blossom: Used ```<section></section>``` for the first time!

:cherry_blossom: Used ```overflow:``` for the first time!

:cherry_blossom: Used ```white-space``` for the first time!

Extra challenge:
I had a little of trouble finding an extra challenge. I tried to do an animated background, but changed my mind and tried to keep it simple.
